# Printing Shop POS System

A simple computer program that helps cashiers and printing shop owners handle daily business operations without doing manual calculations and paperwork.

# How to run?
Launch the PrintPOSApplication.java after the project was imported to any IDE.

## What This Program Does

This program helps printing shop staff by making their work easier. Instead of calculating prices by hand and writing receipts manually, cashiers can:
- Quickly process customer orders for printing, photocopying, and scanning
- Automatically calculate total costs based on pages, color choice, and special options
- Create professional receipts that save as text files
- Change prices for different services when needed

**Important**: This program is designed for shop staff only - customers don't need accounts or login information.

## How It Makes Work Easier

### Simple Order Processing
- **Print Transactions**: Handle document printing requests with automatic price calculation
- **Photocopy Transactions**: Process copy requests with different pricing options  
- **Scan Transactions**: Manage document scanning services with flexible pricing

The cashier only needs to:
1. Choose the service type
2. Enter number of pages
3. Select color preference (black & white or colored)
4. Check if documents include images
5. Add the transaction and generate a receipt

### Easy Price Management
- Set different prices for each service type
- Separate costs for black & white vs colored printing
- Extra charges for documents with images
- Price changes save automatically in a settings file

### Automatic Receipt Creation
- Creates detailed summary of all services provided
- Calculates total cost automatically
- Saves receipts as text files with date and time
- Allows multiple services on one receipt

## Key Features and How They Work

### 1. Main Menu System
**What it does**: Shows three service buttons and a price settings link

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
@FXML
private void handlePrintAction() throws IOException {
    navigateToTransactionScreen("Print");
}

@FXML
private void handlePhotocopyAction() throws IOException {
    navigateToTransactionScreen("Photocopy");
}

@FXML
private void handleScanAction() throws IOException {
    navigateToTransactionScreen("Scan");
}
```
**How it works**: When someone clicks a service button, the program opens the correct input window for that service type.

### 2. Transaction Input System
**What it does**: Collects information about the customer's transaction

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
@FXML
private void handleAddTransaction() throws IOException {
    int pages = Integer.parseInt(numberOfPagesField.getText());
    String colorOption = coloredRadio.isSelected() ? "Colored" : "Monochrome";
    
    Transaction transaction = new Transaction(
        serviceType,
        pages,
        colorOption,
        imagesCheckbox.isSelected()
    );
    
    PrintPOSApplication.addTransaction(transaction);
    navigateToConfirmationScreen();
}
```
**How it works**: Takes the information entered by the cashier, creates a record of the transaction, and moves to the confirmation window.

### 3. Price Calculation System
**What it does**: Automatically calculates costs based on current prices

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
private double calculatePrice() {
    double baseRate = ConfigManager.getPriceForService(serviceType, 
        colorOption.equals("Colored") ? "colored" : "monochrome");
    
    double price = numberOfPages * baseRate;
    
    if (includesImages) {
        price += ConfigManager.getImagesSurcharge();
    }
    
    return price;
}
```
**How it works**: Looks up the current price for the service type and color option, multiplies by number of pages, and adds image charges if needed.

### 4. Price Settings Manager
**What it does**: Lets shop owners change prices for different services

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
public static double getPriceForService(String serviceType, String colorOption) {
    String key = serviceType.toLowerCase() + "." + colorOption.toLowerCase();
    String value = properties.getProperty(key);
    return value != null ? Double.parseDouble(value) : 0.0;
}
```
**How it works**: Reads prices from a settings file and provides them when calculating costs. Can be updated through the price settings window.

### 5. Receipt Creation System
**What it does**: Creates professional receipts and saves them as files

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
@FXML
private void handleConfirmReceipt() {
    LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
    String filename = String.format("Receipt %s Time %s.txt",
        now.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MM-dd-yyyy")),
        now.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("hh-mm-ss a")));
    
    File receiptFile = new File(filename);
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(receiptFile)) {
        writer.write(receiptContent);
    }
}
```
**How it works**: Creates a text file with all transaction details, current date/time, and saves it with a specific naming format for easy organization.

### 6. Transaction Storage System
**What it does**: Keeps track of multiple services for one customer

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
private static ArrayList<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<>();

public static void addTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
    transactions.add(transaction);
}

public static void clearTransactions() {
    transactions.clear();
}
```
**How it works**: Stores all services in a list until the receipt is created, then clears the list for the next customer.

### 7. Transaction Confirmation System
**What it does**: Shows a summary of all transactions before creating the receipt

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
private void displayTransactions() {
    ArrayList<Transaction> transactions = PrintPOSApplication.getTransactions();
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    double total = 0;

    for (Transaction transaction : transactions) {
        sb.append(transaction.toString()).append("\n");
        total += transaction.getPrice();
    }

    sb.append("\nTotal Price: â‚±").append(String.format("%.2f", total));
    transactionsTextArea.setText(sb.toString());
}
```
**How it works**: Creates a detailed summary showing all services, their costs, and the total amount before generating the final receipt.

### 8. Receipt Preview System
**What it does**: Shows what the receipt will look like before saving it

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
public void setReceiptContent(String content) {
    LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
    String receiptDateTime = now.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a"));
    
    String updatedContent = content.replaceFirst(
        "Date: \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}",
        "Date: " + receiptDateTime
    );
    
    this.receiptContent = updatedContent;
    receiptTextArea.setText(updatedContent);
}
```
**How it works**: Shows the receipt in a popup window where staff can review it before saving to make sure everything looks correct.

### 9. Input Validation and Error Handling
**What it does**: Checks for problems with entered information and shows helpful popup messages

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
private void showAlert(String title, String content) {
    Alert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR);
    alert.setTitle(title);
    alert.setHeaderText(null);
    alert.setContentText(content);
    alert.showAndWait();
}

// Validate input
int pages;
try {
    pages = Integer.parseInt(numberOfPagesField.getText());
    if (pages <= 0) {
        showAlert("Invalid Input", "Please enter a positive number of pages.");
        return;
    }
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    showAlert("Invalid Input", "Please enter a valid number of pages.");
    return;
}
```
**How it works**: Checks if the page number is valid (positive number) and shows popup windows with clear error messages if something is wrong.

### 10. Modal Dialog Systems
**What it does**: Opens special popup windows for important tasks like changing prices or previewing receipts

**Code that makes it work**:
```java
@FXML
private void handleCustomizePricing() throws IOException {
    FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("/com/pp/s/printingpos/pricing_config.fxml"));
    Parent root = loader.load();

    Stage stage = new Stage();
    stage.setTitle("Customize Pricing");
    stage.initModality(Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL); // Make it modal
    stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
    stage.showAndWait(); // This will block until the dialog is closed
}
```
**How it works**: Creates popup windows that must be completed before returning to the main program, ensuring important tasks like price changes are handled properly.
